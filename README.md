Whenever we are told to think about something , or we hear,see,remember about something then mind immediately goes or takes attention to that thing. 
Attention and mind are diffirent.When despite of all inputs attention stays on same thing or thought then it is called as patience.
If a person's attention fluctuates easily then person is less patient.This patience is also called concentration.

The more attention one thing or thought is taken at by a person ,that thing comes in person's life.

If person does thinks other person is bad, then person is taking attention towards (other person is bad) , then for this person
that other person will seem bad in some time.

This is indirectly law of attraction / attention
